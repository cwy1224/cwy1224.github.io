Reflection:
Overall, I learned many lessons outside of lectures by going through these assignment and project.
I also learned that teamwork is important because we probably need to work with others to solve problem in our future job.
It is also important to learn about the latest technology landscape and the modern technology applied today.
Finally, I would like to say that this course(Technology and Information System) has helped me deepen my understanding in computing and also coding.
